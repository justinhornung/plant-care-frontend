Did your plant ownership explode during the pandemic lockdown? Are they really thriving under your care? Do you find it difficult keeping up with watering or repotting your plants?  Thatâ€™s my inspiration for a revolutionary plant care app called Plant Pal!

With Plant Pal, you can view tens of thousands of plants and a detailed description containing everything you need to know about the species. You can add your whole plant family to a scheduled watering rotation so they never get stressed, or remember to move them to a sunny location for the afternoon.
